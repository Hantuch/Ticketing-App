# Ticketing-App
This is a rather simple ticketing program that is still in progress, it's based in C

This program utilizes simple C techniques such as Modularity, Header, Loop, Array, Date Acquisition, File Reading, and some more minor features

it is separated into 5 main parts : Menu, List of Film, the Schedule of Chosen Film, Number of Tickets Wanted, Seating Position, and Summary, one of which, the Seating Position, is still considered Imperfect.

We try to minimalizes error by giving users less freedom on input and limits most of user-input to arrow-keys input

Planned Features : - Improved Seating Function (Simulation of Occupied Spaces and Coloration of Occupied & Selected Seating)
                   - Image Processing Function that edits a ticket template and outputs it (either in PNG , HTML, or PDF)

This program was made for team project of course "Algoritma & Pemrograman" at Universitas Indonesia
